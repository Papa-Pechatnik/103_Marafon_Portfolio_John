                <p> How to paint a portrait with vibrant colours with Maria Poliakova </p>
            </div>

            <p class="text">
                We understand it can be difficult working with colors and lighting, so here are some insights
                from the talented and lovely Maria Poliakova. Maria is an artist from Kiev who sometimes goes
                a little crazy with the colors, to great effect.
                <br>
                In this tutorial, Maria gives a step by step process of creating a colourful portrait using
                her Wacom Cintiq Pro 13. She´s excited to share with you some tips, explanations and technical
                details, so you too can learn to draw a portrait with vibrant colours, make colour adjustments
                and organize your workspace.

            <h2>This Series of Abstract Portrait Paintings is Surreal and Bold</h2>

                Finding unique abstract art has become a challenge with the recent explosion of anything
                different and out-of-the-ordinary, but that’s not the case for this stunning abstract
                portrait painting series.
                <br>
                Using a background of bright block colors, Canadian artist Erik Olson’s collection of
                abstract portrait paintings uses experimental techniques to give layers and depth to the
                portraits he paints. Some of his pieces are simple and almost recognizable, while others
                are much more abstract making it harder to make out the features on the face.
                <br>
                Painting his faces using rectangular shapes, Erik’s interesting mix of surrealist and
                realistic work has received the publicity it deserves—the artist has had several
                exhibitions and has won several awards for his work.
